/**
 * [FormBuilder] contract is implemented by any builder using any preferred Schema.
 *
 * [formString] is the string representation of the form depending on the schema which can be JSON
 * YAML or even XML
 *
 * The form builder requires a FragmentActivity [context] which it will use to create its views. If the form is
 * generated with a stepper. That is when the generated form is not embedded into an existing view. The
 * [neatStepperLayout] is the view holding the form steps.
 *
 * The form builder also uses the [formValidator] to validate fields.
 *
 * Before building views, views are first registered withing the [registeredViews] map. This is a map
 * that holds the view type against the actual class type of the view that will used to create the view for example
 *              for an EditText inside the view type map you will have
 *              ["edit_text" -> EditTextNFormView::class]
 *
 * This map can be overridden if you have custom views that you also want rendered. Just remember to register the views
 * before building the form.
 *
